# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: April 09 2022, Saturday.

**Today's Progress**: I've started [Responsive Web Design (Beta)](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/2022/responsive-web-design/)

**Thoughts** It's my first time doing something like that, but I feel like I need to do some work daily to get better at programming. Reached Step 13 on Learn HTML by building a cat photo app.
