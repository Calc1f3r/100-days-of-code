##### (delete me or comment me out)

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts:** I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

**Today's Progress**: I've started [Responsive Web Design (Beta)](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/2022/responsive-web-design/)

**Thoughts** It's my first time doing something like that, but I feel like I need to do some work daily to get better at programming.
